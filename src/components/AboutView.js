            <h2>About TeamScope</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to TeamScope, a showcase of my skills in front-end
              development using React.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a passionate learner and sports enthusiast, I created TeamScope
              to combine my love for sports with my technical expertise. This
              application serves as both a dynamic portfolio piece and a
              testament to my ability to build feature-rich, interactive web
              apps.
